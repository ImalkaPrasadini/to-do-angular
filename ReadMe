📝 Notes

Core CRUD functionality (create, update, delete, and list tasks) is fully implemented and functioning at the UI level.

The application currently uses mock data in place of a backend API.

Some unit tests and refinements are still in progress and may not pass in all scenarios.

This project focuses on demonstrating:

Angular Signals–based state management

Clean service-driven architecture

Modern Angular testing practices
